A camera enabled system used for detecting frames when driver is distracted while driving. If he is distracted for a while, an alert will be generated by the system so that driver can be attentive after that. Also, corresponding to the alert generated, a signal is sent to the higher authorities for rating the driver, for e.g. , OLA or Uber can rate their drivers based on their monthly attentive behaviour.

## Advantages:
* Alert generated can bring driver's attention back to their driving, which will avoid accidents due to driver distractions.
* Government can give incentives to attentive drivers to promote road safety.
* Ride hailing startups can attract more customers by having more number of attentive drivers.

## Business Model:
* Customer Segments: Cab and Bus drivers.
* Unique Value Proposition: No Extra costs other than the costs involved in the Software Development.
* Competitive Advantage: No such robust system currently existing in the market which promotes road safety with such factors.
* Cost Structure: Govt. and startups together can make cost-effective policies (like attentive drivers will get more rides) to give incentives.

## Technology stack:
* Python
* OpenCV
* Keras
* Java
* Android Studio

## Working prototype:
A usual smartphone placed at dashboard (e.g. dashboard of cab drivers) will capture driverâ€™s frames in the background without obstructing current activities of driver (Maps, etc.). These frames will then be passed to a deep learning model classifying his/her driving into safe, moderate or unsafe level of distraction. To ensure frames are not captured unnecessarily while other activities like parking, etc., we have kept a speed threshold of 20 km/h and beyond this, we will start capturing the frames.

Prototype Description:
* Dataset : [State Farm Distracted Driver Detection | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection)
* Dataset has multiple categories but we have merged these into 3 categories ,i.e., safe, unsafe and moderate driving. We have resized, grayscaled and also augmented the data (with various rotations,shifts,etc.), so that model will be more fast and  robust(independent of vehicles/drivers). 
* Finally a Convolutional neural network has been used to train the predictive model.
